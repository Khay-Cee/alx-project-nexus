This is a documentation hub for my major learnings from the ALX ProDev Frontend Engineering program.

## Overview
As part of my **Pro Frontend Development Program**, I researched the **Pro Backend Development track** to understand the skills, tools, and practices it emphasizes. This helped me see how backend knowledge complements frontend expertise in building full-stack applications.

## Major Learnings
- **Key Technologies:** Web Development, Mobile Development, Progressive Web Apps (PWA).  
- **Core Backend Tools & Concepts:** API design & integration, databases (SQL/NoSQL), authentication, system design, and deployment workflows.  
- **Frontend-Backend Link:** Importance of GraphQL, REST APIs, and TypeScript for seamless integration.  

## Challenges & Solutions (Researched)
- **Challenge:** Scaling APIs and handling complex data.  
  **Solution:** Adopt modular architecture, GraphQL for efficient queries, and caching strategies.  
- **Challenge:** Ensuring performance and reliability.  
  **Solution:** System design principles (load balancing, database optimization, microservices).  

## Best Practices & Takeaways
- Maintain clean, well-documented, and testable code.  
- Prioritize security (authentication, authorization, data protection).  
- Use version control and CI/CD pipelines for smooth collaboration.  
- Frontend and backend must align closely for successful full-stack delivery.
